## 🌐 Frontend Layer

### 🟦 `store-front` (Vue.js)
- Customer-facing web app.
- Allows users to browse products and place orders.
- Sends order data to the `order-service`.

### 🟩 `store-admin` (Vue.js)
- Used by store staff to manage products and monitor orders.
- Communicates with `product-service` and `makeline-service`.

---

## ⚙️ Backend Services

### 🔵 `order-service` (JavaScript)
- Receives new orders from `store-front`.
- Publishes orders to **RabbitMQ**.
- Persists order data in `MongoDB`.

### 🟤 `product-service` (Rust)
- Provides CRUD operations for product management.
- Stores product data in `MongoDB`.

### 🟠 `makeline-service` (Golang)
- Subscribes to RabbitMQ queue.
- Processes and completes orders.
- Updates order status in `MongoDB`.

### 🧠 `ai-service` (Python, Optional)
- Optional generative AI features (e.g., image generation, text descriptions).
- Can be used by other services or frontend apps.

---

## 📦 Infrastructure

### 📨 `RabbitMQ`
- Acts as the **order queue** between `order-service` and `makeline-service`.
- Ensures reliable, decoupled message passing.

### 🗃️ `MongoDB`
- Central database for both products and orders.
- Used by multiple services.

---

## 🤖 Simulated Workers

### 🧑‍💻 `virtual-customer` (Rust)
- Simulates customer behavior by placing orders on a schedule.
- Calls the `order-service`.

### 🛠️ `virtual-worker` (Rust)
- Simulates kitchen workers completing orders.
- Interacts with `makeline-service`.

## 🔁 Communication Flow

```text
Customer (store-front) 
   ↓
order-service → RabbitMQ → makeline-service
   ↓                           ↓
 MongoDB                 Updates Order Status

store-admin ↔ product-service / makeline-service
virtual-customer → order-service
virtual-worker → makeline-service
